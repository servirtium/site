            </p>
            <p>Here's what GitHub (for one) renders that like:</p>
            <p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                  href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82182/67832562-f2ced800-fad9-11e9-9bbf-8a366ad7c938.png"><img

            <p>That's the whole point of this format that's human-inspectable in raw form and that your code-portal
                renders in a pretty way too.
                If your code portal is GitHub, then 'pretty' is true.</p>

            </p>
            <p>... and you'd be storing that VCS as you would your automated tests.</p>

            <p>Each interaction has four sections denoted by a *<em>Level 3 Markdown headers</em></p>
            <ol>
                <li>The request headers going from the client to the HTTP server, denoted with a heading like so <code>###
                    Request headers recorded for playback:</code></li>
                <li>The request body going from the client to the HTTP server (if applicable - GET does not use this),
                    denoted with a heading like so <code>### Request body recorded for playback
                        (&lt;MIME-TYPE&gt;):</code>. And <code>&lt;MIME-TYPE&gt;</code> is something like <code>application/json</code>
                </li>
                <li>The response headers coming back from the HTTP server to the client, denoted with a heading like so
                    <code>### Response headers recorded for playback:</code></li>
                <li>The response body coming back from the HTTP server to the client (some HTTP methods do not use
                    this), denoted with a heading like so <code>### Response body recorded for playback (&lt;STATUS-CODE&gt;:
                        &lt;MIME-TYPE&gt;):</code></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Within each of those there is a single Markdown code block (three back-ticks) with the details of each.
                The lines in that
                block may be reformatted depending on the settings of the recorder. If binary, then there is a Base64
                sequence instead (admittedly not so pretty on the eye).</p>

            <p>You'll write your test (say JUnit) and that will use a library (that your company may have written or be
                from a vendor). For
                recording you will swap the real service URL for one running a Servirtium middle-man server (which
                itself will delegate to
                the real service). If that service is flaky - keep re-running the test manually until the service is
                non-flaky, and commit
                that Servirtium-style markdown to source-control. Best practice is to configure the same test two have
                two modes of operation: 'direct' and 'recording' modes.  This is <strong>not</strong> a caching idea
                - it is deliberate
                - you are explicitly recording while running a test, or not recording while running a test (and doing
                direct to the service)</p>
            <p>Anyway, the recording ends up in the markdown described in a text file on your file system - which you'll
                commit to VCS alongside your tests.</p>
            <h3><a id="user-content-playback-of-http-conversations" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"
                   href="#playback-of-http-conversations"><span style="font-size: 65%">🔗</span></a> Playback of HTTP
                conversations</h3>
            <p>Those same markdown recordings are used in playback. Again an explicit mode - you're running in this mode
                and it will fail if there are no recordings in the dir/file in source control.</p>
            <p>Playback itself will fail if the headers/body <strong>sent by the client to the real service</strong>
                (through the Servirtium library)
                are <strong>not</strong> the same they were when the recording was made. It is possible that
                masking/redacting and general manipulations should happen
                deliberately during the recording to get rid of transient aspects that are not helpful in playback
                situations. The test
                failing in this situation is deliberate - you're using this to guard against potential
                incompatibilities.</p>
            <p>For example any dates in headers of the body that go from the client to the HTTP Server could be swapped
                for some date
                in the future like "2099-01-01" or a date in the past "1970-01-01".</p>
            <p>The person who's designing the tests
                that recording or playback would work on the redactions/masking towards an "always passing" outcome,
                with no differences
                in the markdown regardless of the number of time the same test is re-recorded.</p>
            <p>Note: How a difference in request-header or request-body expectation is
                logged in the test output needs to be part of the deliberate design of the tests themselves. This is
                easier said than
                done, and you can't catch assertion failures over HTTP.</p>
            <p>Note2: this is a third mode of operation for the same test as in "Recording a HTTP conversation" above -
                "playback"
                mode meaning you have three modes of operation all in all.</p>
