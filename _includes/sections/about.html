            <ul>
                <li>Developers and test engineers wanting to write fast automated tests that would invoke slow or flaky remote services over HTTP. Devs are going to lead the creation of those, more than test-engineers</li>
                <li>Enlightened vendors and service makers wanting to ship executable know-how to their clients and developer community</li>
                <li>People that super-love Markdown (M⬇) in Git, and look for excuses to lol around in that stuff</li>
                <li>Coders that have JSON fatigue or don't like "test data" (or similar) in a shared service/database</li>
                <li>Vendors making HTTP APIs where their consumer community uses one of a dozen languages, and the vendor doesn't want to ship example code for all of those language choices</li>
