                    What is Servirtium?</h1>
            </div>
            <p>Servirtium aims to be <strong>a lingua franca for mock HTTP conversations using Markdown under
                source-control</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>implementing libraries for many languages with have interoperable record and playback capability.</li>
                <li>agnostic about test-runner choices - use any unit test or spec framework</li>
                <li>use should be "in process" for the testing tech in question (no process spawning)</li>
                <li>Web-API makers should get on board too, shipping markdown conversations for known test scenarios
                    (as well as a sample test that would use that in their preferred language)
                </li>
                <li>tracking incompatibility with vendor or other-team web-APIs is easy and non-CI automation jobs
                    (key TCK concept)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Multiple language implementations would
                be able to work with the same Markdown
                'servirtix' recordings, and it would be possible to record a HTTP conversation with (say) a Ruby library using <code>Test::Unit</code>
                and the play them back via a
                (say) Java library for <code>JUnit</code> or <code>TestNG</code> test-writing teams. That would be for
                the situation where the Ruby team was publishing an API and
                bundled unit tests with it, but the team consuming API was in a different org/department and was using
                Java instead of Ruby.

                In common with other Service Virtualization technologies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>tests can leverage previously recorded HTTP conversations:</li>
                <li>are much faster than real services which can vary in speed at least, but are typically slower than
                    desired
                </li>
                <li>don't fail in unexpected ways - real services can be flaky</li>
                <li>don't require credentials per person running the tests - real services often require API keys/tokens
                    (even "sandbox" ones) and devs often share those against vendor (and employer) rules.
                </li>
                <li>So this would be exclusively for test automation purposes. Production deployments would not use
                    any Servirtium technologies - the <strong>real</strong> services would be hooked up there.

            <p>With Servirtium, the HTTP conversations for services invoked by running tests
                would be recorded and played back from the same Markdown format. Two different teams could negotiate for changes over time in Servirtium markdown recordings. If that were a vendor and a client, the client could ask for (say) hair color in a `/get-person/{id}` web-API by sharing an example of that in markdown. Perhaps an existing `/get-person/{id}` call could be used as a basis. Ideally that need/wish would be in a Git repo and come with a test/spec example of use. Similarly the vendor could communicate forthcoming changes via Servirtium markdown conversations in Git repos (private or public).</p>

            <p>Ruby's <a href="https://github.com/vcr/vcr" rel="nofollow">VCR</a> and ports to other languages with VCR and Betamax-style names are established record/playback web-API service virtualization technologies, but without the canonical markdown data model or an emphasis on the "git diff" TCK aspect. They could easily gain modes of operation to support the Servirtium markdown and be used in the way we suggest.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.mbtest.org/">Mountebank</a> for many years has existed as a advanced way of programmatically mocking your web-APIs (and other wire protocols) and allowing you to co-evolve those towards the business deliverables. We hope Mountebank similarly gains a "dumber" mode of operation to support our markdown format. Similarly there's the more established <a href="https://wiremock.org/">WireMock</a>, <a href="https://docs.pact.io/">Pact</a> ("contract tests" since 2013), Netflix's <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/pollyjs/">Polly.js</a> (new in 2019), Linkedin's <a href="https://github.com/linkedin/flashback">Flashback</a> (since 2017), Specto Lab's <a href="https://hoverfly.io/">Hoverfly</a> (since 2015), and Computer Associate's <a href="https://www.ca.com/gb/products/ca-service-virtualization.html"></a>Lisa since 2014 (unsure what tool name is now, and note that List **is not** co-locating recordings with prod & test source), <a href="https://github.com/intuit/karate/tree/master/karate-netty">Karate</a> (by Intuit-er Peter Thomas for the last two years).
