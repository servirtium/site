            </div>
            <p>Servirtium aims to be <strong>a lingua franca for mock HTTP conversations using Markdown under
                source-control</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>with interoperable record and playback capability in Java, C#, Ruby, Python, NodeJS, Go, Rust and
                    more.
                </li>
                <li>API makers should get on board too, shipping markdown conversations for known test scenarios (as
                    well as a sample test that would use that in their fave language)
                </li>
                <li>oh, and the JSON/YAML recording format used by other technologies is the <strong>wrong</strong>
                    format for encoding HTTP conversations - it is not pretty on the eye and not easily eyeball-diffable
                    ('git diff' - key concept)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2><a id="user-content-in-common-with-other-service-virtualization-technologies" class="anchor"

                    style="font-size: 65%">🔗</span></a> In common with other "Service Virtualization" technologies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>tests can leverage previously recorded HTTP conversations:</li>
                <li>are much faster than real services which can vary in speed at least, but are typically slower than
                    desired
                </li>
                <li>don't fail in unexpected ways - real services can be flaky</li>
                <li>don't require credentials per person running the tests - real services often require API keys/tokens
                    (even "sandbox" ones) and devs often share those against vendor (and employer) rules.
                </li>
                <li>So this would be exclusively for test automation purposes. Production deployments would not use
                    any Servirtium technologies - the <strong>real</strong> services would be hooked up there.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>With Servirtium, the HTTP conversations for services invoked by running tests
                would be recorded and played back from the same Markdown format. Multiple language implementations would
                be able work with the same Markdown
                standard, and it would be possible to record a HTTP conversation with (say) a Ruby library using <code>Test::Unit</code>
                and the play them back via a
                (say) Java library for <code>JUnit</code> or <code>TestNG</code> test-writing teams. That would be for
                the situation where the Ruby team was publishing an API and
                bundled unit tests with it, but the team consuming API was in a different org/department and was using
                Java instead of Ruby.</p>
